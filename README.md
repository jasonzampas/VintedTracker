# ü§ñ Bot Set up

This bot fetches products from Vinted based on popular brand IDs and sends them to specific Discord channels. Follow the steps below to configure it properly.

### üìÅ Files Overview
- **`data/brands.json`**: Contains Vinted brand IDs for popular brands.
- **`data/channels.json`**: Maps brand names (or IDs) to specific Discord channel IDs. This tells the bot where to send product embeds.

### üîß Setup Steps

### 1. Create Channels on Discord
1. Open your Discord server.
2. Decide how to organize the channels and create them:
   - **One channel per brand** (e.g., `#polo-ralph-lauren`, `#supreme`).
   - **One general channel** for all brands (e.g., `#all-products`).

### 2. Enable Developer Mode
To get the IDs of the channels:
1. Open **User Settings** in Discord.
2. Navigate to **Advanced**.
3. Toggle on **Developer Mode**.

---

### 3. Get Channel IDs
1. Right-click on each channel you created.
2. Select **Copy ID**. This gives you the unique ID for that channel.

---

### 4. Update `data/channels.json`
1. Open the file `data/channels.json`.
2. The file should look like this:
   ```json
   {
       "brand_name": 1234567890,
       "another_brand_name": 0987654321
   }
